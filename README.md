# P3_SERVER_NODE
This repository is part of a project of my degree in computer engineering. 
This project consists of facilitating the management of young people in Volleyball. 
Where the actors are parents and coaches, they can easily see the results of their children/athletes and have access to their schedule.
In this repository there is the API(NODE EXPRESS) to connect the react app & react native app to the Database in MariaDb.
